Tie::Assert 

0.20   - Major changes.  The addition of the Tie::Assert::Array and
          Tie::Assert::Hash classes, and a rewriting of the internal
	  representation of filters to support this.
0.12   - The Build.PL had 'requires' typoed as 'required', breaking the
          installation on machines without B::Flags.  This has been
	  fixed.
0.11   - Rationalised the version number, no actual code/doc changes beyond
          this
0.1_01 - Added the README file.	
         Changed Build.PL to also create Makefile.PL for traditional build.
         Fixed a typo in the documentation where the tied() keyword was
	  spelt ties().
0.1    - Initial release.
